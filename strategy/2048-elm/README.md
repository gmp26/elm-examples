2048-elm
========

A clone of [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) (itself a clone of [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024)) using [FRP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming) in [elm](http://elm-lang.org/).

[Play here!](http://scrambledeggsontoast.github.io/2048-elm/build/)

The main intention of this project is to serve as a learning exercise for myself, and to provide an example to others who are trying to learn FRP and elm. With that in mind, if you see anything that has been done in a less than optimal way, feel free to fork and open a pull request, or just to let me know about it.
